## Ansible Test Suite Famedly

We're targeting the last two minor ansible-core releases, and all Python
versions newer than what Debian stable is shipping. That means, we currently
support all combinations of the following, except for Python 3.11 with
ansible-core 2.13.6, because Python 3.11 support only arrived in 2.14.0.
 - **Python**: 3.9, 3.10, 3.11
 - **ansible-core**: 2.13.6, 2.14.0
